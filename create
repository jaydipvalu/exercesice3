For more complex cases, there are various methods for resolving them. There are also Git GUI apps that can help by visualizing the differences.

To fix conflicts locally, you can use the following method:

Open the terminal and checkout your feature branch, for example, my-feature-branch:

<<<<<<< HEAD
Open the conflicting file2   in  a code editor of your name.
=======
Open the conflicting file2   in  a code editor of your preference.
>>>>>>> 9e2699d (update code)
