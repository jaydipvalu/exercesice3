For more complex cases, there are various methods for resolving them. There are also Git GUI apps that can help by visualizing the differences.

To fix conflicts locally, you can use the following method:

Open the terminal and checkout your feature branch, for example, my-feature-branch:
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

Open the conflicting file in a code editor of your preference.
>>>>>>> a3b6dd4 (same file differnet changes)
